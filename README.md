# My 4-Year College Journey
Welcome to my repository where I am documenting my entire 4-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Information Technology (BSc.CSIT) journey. Here, you'll find notes, study materials, resources, and project documentation for each course I take over these 4 years.Hopefully people studying CSIT or any other CS degree will find this helpful in their journey as well.
# Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders for each semester, and within those folders, you'll find sub-folders for each course. Each course folder contains:
* Lecture notes
* Resources (links to useful websites, videos, books, etc.)
* Assignments and projects
* Exam preparation materials
* Many personal recommended resources
