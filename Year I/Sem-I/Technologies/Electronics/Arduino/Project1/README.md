# Arduino Project: Temperature and Humidity Monitor

## Overview

As i got the order of my arduino this evening i am trying to make my first project using it.This project is an Arduino-based begginer level project. The goal of this project is just to start with arduino programming and to gain a basic idea of how project can be made using arduino also to have some understanding about electronics. This project is designed for beginners and utilizes basic components to demonstrate the capabilities of what a simple chip having basic elctronics component can create.
